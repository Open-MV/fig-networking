# FIG Charter


## Overview of FIG

The Networking Foundational Interest Group (FIG) is focused on open source and standards pertaining to transport architecture, services, and operations, enabling data transmission across various digital mediums in a global environment. This work includes scaling, latency, security, access, and discovery across many hardware and software platforms.

## Goals

- Major goals that FIG seeks to generally achieve

## Scope

* Understand and extend global namespace systems for naming, discovery, and location of endpoint worlds and simulations.
* Define interoperable and extensible namespace schema for discovery and access to object-based elements like containers, assets, scenes, and components used to compose and interact with a world or simulation.
* Identify and augment current network infrastructure services to enable centralized and decentralized objectsâ€™ localized data cache and compute requirements.
* Create schema with metadata access for queryable discovery and trending to enable proactive replication of media objects and environments. 
* Create an extensible model for data storage exposure with access and permissions to enable analytics and live operation data models to internal and external systems.
* Define network metadata schema to allow reporting of the medium, bandwidth, and latent capabilities of server and client endpoints.
