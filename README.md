# Open Metaverse Foundation Interest Group for Networking (FIG Networking)

This repository holds materials for the Open Metaverse Foundation Interest Group for Legal and Policy (FIG Legal and Policy).

## Description of FIG Legal and Policy

The Networking Foundational Interest Group (FIG) is focused on open source and standards pertaining to transport architecture, services, and operations, enabling data transmission across various digital mediums in a global environment. This work includes scaling, latency, security, access, and discovery across many hardware and software platforms.
See the [FIG's charter](governance/FIG-Charter.md) for full details.

## What does the Foundational Interest Group do?

* Understand and extend global namespace systems for naming, discovery, and location of endpoint worlds and simulations.
* Define interoperable and extensible namespace schema for discovery and access to object-based elements like containers, assets, scenes, and components used to compose and interact with a world or simulation.
* Identify and augment current network infrastructure services to enable centralized and decentralized objects’ localized data cache and compute requirements.
* Create schema with metadata access for queryable discovery and trending to enable proactive replication of media objects and environments. 
* Create an extensible model for data storage exposure with access and permissions to enable analytics and live operation data models to internal and external systems.
* Define network metadata schema to allow reporting of the medium, bandwidth, and latent capabilities of server and client endpoints.

### Who can attend or participate?

The OMF cannot work without the help and input from as many of its community members as possible. You do not need anyone’s permission to get involved and contribute to the project. The #artificial-intel channel on OMF Discord is a great place to begin getting involved. Many of our community members regularly share ideas, updates, and resources there. You can also find a number of topics under the GitHub Discussions area which need your input.
